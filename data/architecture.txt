System architecture:

The application has three main layers:
1. The Frontend (Gradio interface) for chatting with the agent.
2. The Middleware (Agent Loop) which coordinates reasoning and tool calls.
3. The Backend (Tools + Local RAG Index).

Each layer communicates using message passing.
The agent core maintains an internal scratchpad for reasoning.
All tools are stateless and return structured JSON objects.
